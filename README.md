# Drummm-Kittt
Create a drum kit using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML structures the drum elements, CSS styles them for visual appeal, and JavaScript adds interactivity, enabling drum sounds upon clicking or keyboard input. Use event listeners to trigger sounds and CSS transitions for dynamic visual feedback, offering an engaging user experience.
